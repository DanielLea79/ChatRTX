### Installer

If you are using [ChatRTX installer](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chatrtx/), setup of the models selected during installation is done by the installer. 

### ChatRTX Backend APIs

[ChatRTX APIs](https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/winai/chatrtx-apis) serve as the foundation for the ChatRTX application, providing backend inference and RAG capabilities. These APIs allow developers to seamlessly integrate their applications with the inference engine and utilize the various AI models supported by ChatRTX. This integration enables developers to incorporate advanced AI inference and RAG features into their applications
